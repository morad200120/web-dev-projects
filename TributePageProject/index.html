            <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug was an American agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the
                extensive increases in agricultural production termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple
                honors for his work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the
                Congressional Gold Medal.</p>

            <p>Borlaug's work has been estimated to have saved over a billion people worldwide from starvation. He is
                one of only seven people to have won the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the
                Congressional Gold Medal. He was also awarded the Padma Vibhushan, India's second-highest civilian
